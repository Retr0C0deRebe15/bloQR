## We are using another repository at https://github.com/Retr0C0deRebe15/bloQR_Backend

## What is the name of your App?
BloQR

<br /><br />
## What does your app do?
Verify and secure QR codes using the blockchain. 
When you scan a QR code, you wouldn't know if it is a legitimate one, or a fake one until you open the link or data within it. 
With BloQR, we can leverage the blockchain to verify if the QR code is legitimate by verifying it against an NFT created on the blockchain from the creator's wallet address at the time of creating the QR Code. We call these new QR codes as BloQR codes.
Use any QR scanner to scan BloQR codes, but get the security check done by us before you actually access the information stored in it. All you need to do is provide the creator's website and the provider to list their blockchain address on their website.
To generate BloQR codes, you can use our application to link your cryptocurrency wallet and mint NFT for each QR code you create.
